# Fresh Tomatoes

This is the final project for _Programming Fundamentals_ in the **Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nandodegree Program**.

The project is to create the server-side code to store a list of movies with box art imagery and a movie trailer URL.
The code generates a static web page which allows visitors to brows the movies and watch trailers.

## Getting Started

Running _entertainment_center.py_ will generate an html page called _fresh_tomatoes.html_. 
Opening this file will allow you to view the web page.

## Extra Features

I added 2 small features that I hope are appreciated:

- Movie Ratings-- Using a predefined class variable `VALID_RATINGS`, I added the attribute `rating` to the movie class to include the movie's MPAA rating.
- Parent Class-- I set up the class the `Video` as parent class to `Movie` and `TvShow`.
  This allows for expansion in the future to list TV Shows on the website.

Enjoy!
